## Design

The application is based on a Bootstrap theme (Small Business)[https://startbootstrap.com/template/small-business]

### Structure

Simplicity, clarity and ease of navigation between pages were the key aspects for design of this website's structure.

At the top of the page there is a recognisable type of navigation bar with website name on the left side and the navigation links to the right which collapses to hamburger icon on smaller screen sizes.

- The website consists of the following sections:

The following models were created to represent the database model structure for the website:

##### User Model
